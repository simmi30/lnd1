# Release Notes

## Bug Fixes

* [Return the nearest known fee rate when a given conf target cannot be found
  from Web API fee estimator.](https://github.com/brolightningnetwork/broln/pull/6062)

* [We now _always_ set a channel type if the other party signals the feature
  bit](https://github.com/brolightningnetwork/broln/pull/6075).

## Remote signing

The [remote signing](../remote-signing.md) setup was simplified in that the
signing node now [does not need to be hooked up to its own chain
backend](https://github.com/brolightningnetwork/broln/pull/6006). A new mock chain
backend can be specified with `--brocoin.node=nochainbackend`. That way a wallet
will be created and all signing RPCs work but the node will not look at any
chain data. It can therefore be fully offline except for a single incoming gRPC
connection from the watch-only node.

## Wallet

* A bug that prevented opening anchor-based channels from external wallets when
  the internal wallet was empty even though the transaction contained a
  sufficiently large output belonging to the internal wallet
  [was fixed](https://github.com/brolightningnetwork/broln/pull/5539).
  In other words, freshly-installed broln can now be initialized with multiple
  channels from an external (e.g. hardware) wallet *in a single transaction*.

* When the block height+delta specified by a network message is greater than
  the gossiper's best height, it will be considered as premature and ignored.
  [These premature messages are now saved into a cache and processed once the
  height has reached.](https://github.com/brolightningnetwork/broln/pull/6054)

* A bug that allowed fees to be up to 100% of the payment amount was fixed by
  [introducing a more sane default
  value](https://github.com/brolightningnetwork/broln/pull/6226) of 5% routing fees
  (except for small amounts <= [1k
  satoshis](https://github.com/brolightningnetwork/broln/pull/6234) where the 100%
  routing fees are kept to accommodate for the base fee in channels). To avoid
  falling back to a default value, users should always set their own fee limits
  by using the `--fee_limit` or `--fee_limit_percent` flags on the `lncli
  payinvoice`, `lncli sendpayment` and `lncli queryroutes` commands. Users of
  the gRPC or REST API should set the `fee_limit` field on the corresponding
  calls (`SendPayment`, `SendPaymentSync`, `QueryRoutes`).

## Database

* [Speed up graph cache loading on startup with
Postgres](https://github.com/brolightningnetwork/broln/pull/6111)

  using itest harness outside of
  broln](https://github.com/brolightningnetwork/broln/pull/6050).

* [Export `lntest` base node config so it can be re-used in LiT integration
  tests](https://github.com/brolightningnetwork/broln/pull/6139).

## Bug fixes

* [Add json flag to
  trackpayment](https://github.com/brolightningnetwork/broln/pull/6060)

  anchor outputs and failing back HTLCs.](https://github.com/brolightningnetwork/broln/pull/6158)

* [Return the nearest known fee rate when a given conf target cannot be found
  from Web API fee estimator.](https://github.com/brolightningnetwork/broln/pull/6062)

  bit](https://github.com/brolightningnetwork/broln/pull/6075).

* [Add `--json` flag to
  `trackpayment`](https://github.com/brolightningnetwork/broln/pull/6060).

  constraints](https://github.com/brolightningnetwork/broln/pull/6073).

* [Fix memory corruption in Mission Control
  Store](https://github.com/brolightningnetwork/broln/pull/6068)
 
* [Ensure that the min relay fee is always clamped by our fee
  floor](https://github.com/brolightningnetwork/broln/pull/6076)

* [Clarify log message about not running within
  systemd](https://github.com/brolightningnetwork/broln/pull/6096)

* [Fix memory corruption in Mission Control

* [Clarify invalid config timeout
  constraints](https://github.com/brolightningnetwork/broln/pull/6073)

* A conflict was found in connecting peers, where the peer bootstrapping
  process and persistent connection could compete connection for a peer that
  led to an already made connection being lost. [This is now fixed so that
  bootstrapping will always ignore the peers chosen by the persistent
  connection.](https://github.com/brolightningnetwork/broln/pull/6082)

## RPC Server

* [ChanStatusFlags is now
  exposed](https://github.com/brolightningnetwork/broln/pull/5971) inside
  WaitingCloseResp from calling `PendingChannels`.

  transactions](https://github.com/brolightningnetwork/broln/pull/5854).

### Code cleanup, refactor, typo fixes

* [Refactored itest to better manage contexts inside integration tests](https://github.com/brolightningnetwork/broln/pull/5756).

  update channel policy](https://github.com/brolightningnetwork/broln/pull/5711)
  to prevent truncation error with tiny fee rates.
